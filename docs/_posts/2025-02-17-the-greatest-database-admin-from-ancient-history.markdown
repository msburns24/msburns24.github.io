As data scientists, we work closely with databases. They are an old system of storing data, going back to the 1960s and used to manage information for a variety of disciplines. While we are most familiar with the systems such as the relational database, there are many variations of databases if we are to abstract the term. At its core, databases store information. In this sense, humans have been managing databases for millennia. Particular for those who take great value in learning, we guard our knowledge with a fierce passion. 


## The Oldest Database

The Library of Alexandria is one of the most well-known ancient libraries, built in Egypt in 3rd Century BCE. While it is one of the most widely-known ancient libraries, it is by no means the first. The oldest known systematically-organized library is the **Library of Ashurbanipal**, assembled by King Ashurbanipal of Ancient Assyria. It was assembled in the 7th Century BCE in Nineveh, located in modern-day Iraq. 

Though it's not as well-known as the one in Alexandria, the Library of Ashurbanipal is the first known effort to collect and organize literary texts beyond administrative needs, simply for the purpose of preserving knowledge. The Library was composed of nearly 30,000 clay tablets, inscribed with writings from a variety of languages, and storing text about religion, politics, medicine, history, poetry, and even magic. The greatest of the library's holdings is the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, a major influence on the writers of Ancient Greece. 

In addition to being the oldest systematically-organized library, Ashurbanipal's collection is acknowledged by scholars and historians for its meticulous organization. The tablets contained a form of metadata known as **colophons**, indicating the position, filing method, and ownership of the literature. 

King Ashurbanipal was unusually well-educated for his time, taking a great interest in books and literature of the region. In his effort to preserve knowledge, he kept the habit of sending "shopping lists" to scholars within his cities, demanding that they share copies of their texts to add to his collection.


## What can we learn from the Ancient King of Assyria?

The story of the Library of Ashurbanipal offers several lessons for data scientists, particularly around data collection, organization, and preservation. 

### 1. Curation and Organization

King Ashurbanipal didn't invent the library, but he is still held in high-regard within the historical community. While he strived to collect a great deal of data, simply possessing information wasn't enough: he took deliberate efforts to curate and organize his collection. 

A well-structured dataset should mirror Ashurbanipal's principles, maintaining good metadata and schema design to enhance usability and promote FAIR data principles. Just as the library allowed historians to learn a great deal about Ancient Mesopotamia, we too can enable future data scientists to gain insights from our well-maintained data.

### 2. Preservation Through Documentation

As part of his organizational efforts, King Ashurbanipal ensured consistent documentation of his texts through metadata (the "colophons"), as well as keeping duplicate copies and structured storage. Valuable datasets can be lost or misinterpreted, so maintaining backups and clear documentation will prevent the data from losing its value over time. Using data catalogs and version control like Git can help prevent this loss of value.

### 3. Diverse Datasets

The King had a passion for collecting knowledge, which ultimately drove him to start the library. His passion was in divination, but that was not the only type of text he collected. He sought out the best texts of the era, spanning disciplines like history, medicine, astronomy, politics, and literature. 

This diversity of data sources contributed to the overall fame of the library. By integrating data from a variety of sources, we can gain better insights and predictions. Many data scientists focus on a single type of data, such as structured data, but we can unlock deeper patterns by expanding and combining other types of data like unstructured or semi-structured data. Cross-domain knowledge can improve insights and robustness as well.


## Conclusion

The Library of Ashurbanipal is a powerful story, reminding us of the importance of data collection and preservation. The King of Ancient Assyria assembled a plethora of knowledge within his collection, but also sought to keep his data organized and documented. Whether we are dealing with cuniform tablets or modern machine learning datasets, the principles of curation and governance remain as prevalent as they have for nearly 3,000 years.
