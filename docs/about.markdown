Hey, I'm Matt!

I've been programming ever since I was a kid, more seriously for the last
8 years, and have been working with data for the last 6-ish years. I love
every part of it.

I'm currently enrolled in a Master of Applied Data Science program, so I'm
making this site to post the things I'm learning and the progress I'm making.

Stay in touch for more to come!
